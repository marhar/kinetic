(Some notes originally by Yan Weiliang. some of these are done.)

1. For global variables, the name space must be used. The namespace must be created in config/kap-init.tcl. Namespace was added in Tcl since v8.0. Then we should upgrade the Tcl package if it is in lower version in field.
2. For source command the $CWD env variable should be the location of the page. Critical!!!
3. The parsing procedure of kap-init.tcl should give the error msg. Walkarround: source the kap-init.tcl directly in a tclsh.
4. The $AIOBS4_HOME/lib/opr.so must be compiled without -lthread. Mark suggested build with -mt option.
5. The POST variables are stored in CGI array and have nothing to do with env array, such as REMOTE_ADDR, SCRIPT_NAME. Should we port CGI data into env? If we do so how can we clean CGI data from env array after processing?
6. Now engine writes file code.out into the page local dir. If the server runner have no write access, what will happen?
7. The plugin don't have timeout mechamism.
8. The next version should implement with socket to connect to engines.
9. The special chars in post data must de decoded. Such are crlf, |, etc.
10.The kap-t.log should be more detail. Suggest to add time, etc.
11.Chinese support?
12.The KAP functions other than ::kap::redirect? Such as encode, decode. loadpage.
13. If the engine run for a long period, should it be restarted periodly?
