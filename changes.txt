KAP Change Log

1.  1999/11/04. Extracted from internal CVS repository, deleted a bunch of the
    useless junk, and tarred it up.

------------------- Released version 0.1 ---------------------

2.  1999/11/05. Lots of makefile cleanup, nuked a lot of unnecessary files,
    puts some others in unclassified/.  Builds cleanly under
    solaris.

------------------- Released version 0.2 ---------------------

3.  1999/11/11.  Added config file stuff (but not integrated yet).
    Fixed apache plugin.  Now it works, but doesn't process cookies
    and cgi data.  "make install" works.  Regression tests that
    don't use cookies and cgi data work.
    
------------------- Released version 0.3 ---------------------

4.  1999/11/11.  Added autoconf configuration.
    
------------------- Released version 0.4 ---------------------

5.  1999/11/22.  Fixed some autoconf stuff.  Added support for
    GET and POST variables from apache.  If this works, then
    After some more documentation we will release it as 1.1.
    Skipping to release 0.9 to demonstrate confidence. :-)

------------------- Released version 0.9 ---------------------
