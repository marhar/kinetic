This is the distribution for KAP, the Kinetic Application Processor.
It is a plugin for the Netscape and Apache web servers that allows
you to embed Tcl into web pages using <tcl></tcl> tags.

There are quite a few things that need to be cleaned up, but the
Netscape version has been working well in production use for
quite a while.

This is a pre-release version, I wanted to make it more beautiful,
but I'm taking Guy Kawasaki's advice to "Don't Worry, Be Crappy."
