Configuring KAP
---------------

Quick Guide
-----------

    ./configure; make; make install

Longer Guide
------------

There are two versions of KAP -- one for netscape, and one
for apache.  They use the same logic engine (kap-t), but
different plugins.

You can build and install either or both versions.
By default, both versions are built.

KAP uses autoconf to configure the system.  Autoconf paramters
are:

  --enable-apache         build apache version (default ON)
  --enable-netscape       build netscape version (default ON)

  --enable-apache=no      do not build apache version
  --disable-apache

  --enable-netscape=no    do not build netscape version
  --disable-netscape

  --with-apxs=PATH        use apxs (apache config tool) from PATH
  --with-tcl=DIR          specify location of tcl base dir

If you have a fairly "normal" system, Tcl will reside in
under /usr/local or /usr.  If not, specify the directory
where Tcl has been installed:

        --with-tcl=/tmp/mytcl

If you are building the apache plugin, the system needs to
use the apache installation program "apxs".  If it does
not reside in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin you need to
specify its location:

        --with-apxs=/tmp/apache/bin/apxs

(Many people have difficulty spelling apxs, so be careful, OK?)

Building and Installing KAP
---------------------------

Once you have run configure, all you need to to is build and
install.  Like most open source software, just execute

        make
        make install

Netscape-only installation
--------------------------

        ./configure --disable-apache
        make
        make install

Apache-only installation
------------------------

        ./configure --disable-netscape
        make
        make install

A complicated real-life example
-------------------------------

I was testing the installation on a solaris box that had
neither Tcl nor Apache already installed.  So, I installed
and built Tcl in the directory /tmp/80  (--prefix=/tmp/80)
and Apache in /tmp/apache (--prefix=/tmp/apache).

So the configure line to build an apache only version of KAP
with the above installed packages is (split onto three lines):

$ ./configure --with-tcl=/tmp/80 
              --with-apxs=/tmp/apache/bin/apxs
              --disable-netscape


Installing the User Guide and Test Cases
----------------------------------------

The subdirectories doc/ and tests/ contain the online
reference and regression test cases for KAP.  You can
either copy them into your httpd tree, or make a
symbolic link to the actual subdirectories.  I prefer
making the symbolic link, since then I don't need to
worry about getting them out of sync with the CVS
repository.

Editing the Apache config files
-------------------------------

By default, the Apache installation edits the apache
config file to associate the file extention "*.ktcl"
with KAP applications.  So if you make a file hello.ktcl
it will be processed by KAP.

There are other ways to configure the server -- you can
make a special directory for all KAP files, or you can
use the per-directory config options to customize how
KAP files are processed in particular directories.

Editing the Netscape config files
---------------------------------

Netscape lags behind apache in this area.  You have
to edit the config file yourself or use the web-based
admin tool to do so.  I will put some examples here
shortly.
